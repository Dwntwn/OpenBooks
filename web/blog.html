					<h3>15,000 hits</h3>
					<p class="subtitle">March 2 2016</p>
					<p class="copy">It's truly amazing to me to have reached this milestone. In September 2014, a few days after I created this site, I was celebrating 2000 hits. Chromebooks was, at first, just an attempt to relive the old Geocities 90s web design style. Since then, it has evolved into the site it is today. I couldn't be more thankful to all of you for the inspiration to continue this project. In honor of this milestone, I have created <a href="http://liquidcrystal.neocities.org/" target="_blank">LIQUID CRYSTAL</a>, a new site that continues the design from Chromebooks 1.8. </p>
          <p>Thank you. </p>

					<h3>Update Schedule</h3>
					<p class="subtitle">March 1 2016</p>
					<p class="copy">I've decided to make a schedule for updating OpenBooks. Starting from now on, I won't be waiting to update OpenBooks; new features will be published every Tuesday. This means whatever I've worked on will be uploaded that week. This also means updates will be a lot faster now. If needed, I will make minor tweaks throught the rest of the week, with new content coming on Fridays.</p>
          <p class="copy">
            This is what the update schedule looks like so far:
          </p>
            <table align="center">
              <tr>
                <td><p>3/1</p></td>
                <td><p>OpenBooks 3.1</p></tr>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td><p>3/8</p></td>
                <td><p>OpenBooks 3.2</p></tr>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td><p>3/15</p></td>
                <td><p>OpenBooks 3.3</p></tr>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td><p>3/22</p></td>
                <td><p>OpenBooks 3.4</p></tr>
              </tr>
            </table>
          <p class="copy">Tuesday updates will always increase the second number, 3.4 to 3.5 for examples. Secret updates will add a second number to the end, 3.4.1 or 3.4.2.</p>
          <p class="copy">Major releases will now occur the first week of every February and August, so in August of this year, I'll be releasing OpenBooks 4.0. Keeping a schedule like this helps me to stay motivated and working on OpenBooks.</p>
          <p class="copy">This doesn't mean I'll be updating the site every Tuesday. I'll be updating it only when I have actually made any changes. </p>
          <p class="copy">In short, the schedule looks like this:</p>
          <table align="center">
            <tr>
              <td><p>Monday</p></td>

            <tr>
              <td><p>Wednesday/Thursday</p></td>

            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><p>Friday</p></td>
              <td><p>Content updates (Blog, Articles, Music, Downloads)</p></tr>

					<h3>In development again...</h3>
					<p class="subtitle">February 5 2016</p>
					<p class="copy">It seems like every time I publish an update, I disappear for a while. Well, I'm still doing some other things elsewhere, my main site, <a href="http://exley.xyz">exley.xyz</a>, has been launched. Right now, it's just a landing page with a few links to where I can be found on the 'net. OpenBooks updates have been planned up to 3.0, so I won't be going anywhere for a while. Right now, OpenBooks XP Service Pack 1 is under development, which will continue the redesign. It'll also retire a couple of features, and introduce one I'm really excited about. I have a lot to do before I can release OpenBooks XP 2, which will be the last major 2.x release. OpenBookx XP 3.0 will return to a unified numbering system. The XP name will probably be dropped later on, when I refine the design again. </p>

					<h3>OpenBooks XP</h3>
					<p class="subtitle">January 7 2016</p>
					<p class="copy">I'm proud to announce the biggest update to OpenBooks yet. Last month, the Network Neighborhood and I went open source on Github, and now work on OpenBooks since has steadily continued due to a sudden, large amount of free time ;). OpenBooks 2.5 contains more changes than any other update I've published so far, and a new overall visual style. Be sure to check the update notes! More soon to come...</p>

					<h3>OpenBooks 2.1</h3>
					<p class="subtitle">November 5 2015</p>
					<p class="copy">After a bit of a delay, OpenBooks 2.1 is here. 2.1 marks the first major update to OpenBooks since the rebuild. This one was mostly visual changes. Usually, visual changes would only warrent a minor update, but because there were so many, we got a larger version bump. Not all of the features I had planned made it into the update, but a few did. One of those is Articles. OpenBooks Articles has now entered beta, and articles can be submitted to my email address. I'll also be publishing my own soon. </p>
					<p class="copy">Future plans: 2.2 will include the Directory and Gallery, both features I originally intended for 2.1. 2.1 needed to be released because I meant for the visual changes to occur weeks ago, but school comes first and I haven't had the time. Luckily though, I now have a bit more time to devote to OpenBooks and should be able to keep up a consistent release schedule. Fun fact: I have more planned than just this website.</p>

					<h3>OpenBooks 2.0 Released</h3>
					<p class="subtitle">October 9 2015</p>
					<p class="copy">OpenBooks has been completely redesigned and rebuilt. I couldn't be happier with it. But as always, there's still much to do.</p>
					<h2>So what's next?</h2>
					<p class="copy">I need to make some adjustments for the website to work better in Internet Explorer (it doesn't display colors properly) and I want to finish the Directory and Gallery. Right now, I don't have much to add to them. Within the next few weeks, we should reach ChromeBooks 2.1 which will take us out of beta.</p>
